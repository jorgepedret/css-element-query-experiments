      h1 Tyson Matanich's Element Query Polyfill
      p This experiment is using <a href="https://github.com/tysonmatanich/elementQuery">Tyson Matanich's polyfill for Element Queries</a>. It was really easy to implement it and it worked as advertised.
      
      p This experiment features a testimonial component that changes depending on its own size. There are 3 breakpoints, which you can clearly see in the CSS file <a href="css/polyfill.css">polyfill.css</a>.
      
      p Resize your browser to see how the testomonials change depending on their size.
